# TypingGym
Small project I built to refresh my knowledge of React. A focus on optimization was crucial because the dom rendering happens
on every key stroke, which at 40 words per minute is 4 rerenders per second, on a continual basis. Each key stroke leads to multiple 
animated css transitions, as well as a recalculation of multiple performance statistics.
